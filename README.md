NumberFactory
=============

Starting out as a small javascript to convert a string representation of a number into words,
we are evolving into a general purpose utility that can pull some uncommon properties from numbers

It creates a javascript object that has certain methods that operate on the number.


to use, instantiate a new object like so

const o = new NumberFactory("676,38.353");

some of the expected output

o.words            // sixty seven thousand six hundred and thirty eight point three five three
o.integerString    // 67638
o.decimalString    // 353
o.formatedString   // 67,638.353
o.integerPrecision // 5
o.decimalPrecision // 3
o.precision        // 8


vitrexx2002, consider adding more functionality
-----------------------------------------------
 
for example

o.isEven --> return true if the number is even, otherwise false

o.hex  --> convert the number to hexadecimal output

o.isPrime -> check if the number is a prime number


Ammend the html file to show off the functions of your script


I think you can use something called 'live server' in vscode.

or
but i just openied a command prompt in the folder that conatins index.html and ran

python3 -m http-server 8001

this starts a webserver using the current directory as its home and then the project can be accesed  by pointing my web browser to

http://localhost:8001
